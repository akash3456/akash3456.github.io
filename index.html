                            Trading oil and gold futures – Since January I have been trading futures and on my first I turned £250 into £1875. I still do it and have had tremendous success as well as failures however if given a sufficient amount of capital
                            that be can be turned into at least 100k as I have done on my practice account due to the very low price of oil at this moment in time. Can provide evidence of this also. Reasons for this were a hunger to achieve financial
                            independence. Gambling is also an occasional interest which see me profit from a donald trump election victory and as a result I managed to turn £500 into £3006 and have since invested that money into various oil companies.
